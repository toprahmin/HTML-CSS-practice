    <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>After reading through this site you will have learned what it was really
         like to have grown up in these streets. I would like to add that experiences
          encountered during this journey are not to be repeated unless your goal
           is to be where I am today. Repeat at your own risk.</p>

      <p>Throughout the journey these streets have taught me a lot. Such as, Pat's
         and Geno's only get customers who dont live in Philly. Also, dont just
         go around picking up any dollar bill you see on the ground. Chances are
          it may be a poop Dollar. Another tip, turn signals are just that, signals.
          They aren't used for asking someone permission to enter their lane. You
          tell them you are coming into their lane.
